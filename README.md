# Skin segmentation and classification

This project has been created to segment the skin pixels from an image and then classify them as Caucasian/non-Caucasian.

We have built a feedforward neural network from scratch on MATLAB for this project. The neural networks have been trained using advanced optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Galactic Swarm Optimization (GSO) and we were able to achieve a shorter training time and lower Root Mean Square Error using GSO.

To run the code, please follow these steps:
1. You will need to download the Computer Vision Toolbox: https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/
2. Run the file newFaceDetect.m to run inference on an image.
