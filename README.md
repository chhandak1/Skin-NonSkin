# Skin segmentation

This project has been created to segment the skin pixels from an image and then classify them as Caucasian/non-Caucasian.

We have used feedforward neural networks for this process. The neural networks have been trained using advanced optimization algorithms like PSO and GSO and we were able to achieve a shorter training time and lower Root Mean Square Error using GSO.
